# AHK-Scripts

I keep a collection of my favorite AHK scripts that I made to automate some of the annoyances of my life and make weird UX things better. 

- URL_to_PDF simply takes a URL and makes it into a PDF. Requires [Percollate](https://github.com/danburzo/percollate). 
- MegaClip lets you create a temporary array of your clipboard so you can copy a lot of items from one location and then repaste them to another location without having to hop back and forth.
- FigmaSaver allows you to use your native file system to create folders for your Figma Files. Purpose of this was to avoid paying for premium Figma but still be able to organize my files into folders.
